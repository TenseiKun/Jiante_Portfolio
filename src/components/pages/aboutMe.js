            I'm a straightforward kind of person. I'm not big on reading, but give me a good anime or game, and I'm set. I'm a gamer, anime enthusiast, and someone who's always got music playing in the background.

            Programming is my main hobby—not because I have to, but because I genuinely enjoy it. I’m not into design, and I’m not multilingual either, but I focus on what I’m good at and what I actually enjoy. I keep things simple and real, aiming to do what I love and make the most of it.
